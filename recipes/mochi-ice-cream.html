        <h2><em>Description</em></h2>
        <p>Twelve servings of soft, chewy mochi stuffed with your favorite ice cream.</p>
    
        <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup sweet rice flour</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
            <li>2 tbsp powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>Optional: Food coloring, color is your choice</li>
            <li>Cornstarch, for dusting/rolling</li>
            <li>Ice cream of your choice</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Make twelve small scoops of ice cream and place them on the paper.
                Let the ice cream remain in a ball, but let them sit flat on the sheet pan.
            </li>
            <li>Stir the flour, sugar, powdered sugar, and water in a microwave-safe bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and microwave for 1 minute.
                Fold the mixture with a wet spatula then microwave for an additional minute, then do this once more but for 30 seconds.
            </li>
            <li>Cover a piece of parchment paper with cornstarch. Scoop the mochi dough from the bowl onto it, and be careful not to touch it yet.</li>
            <li>Dust the top of the mochi with cornstarch, then use a rolling pin to roll the dough into a rectangle.
                When the dough is 1/4" thick, refrigerate it for 30 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Cut the mochi into twelve large squares with scissors, then use a biscuit cutter to cut circles into the dough.
                Take the mochi that was cut out and press ice cream into its center. Press the dough around the ice cream, and pinch the edges to seal it.
            </li>
            <li>Cover each individual ice-cream filled mochi ball with plastic wrap, and place them all back in the freezer.
                Freeze for another hour before eating.
            </li>
        </ol>
